Gauss Jordan Elimination
======================

A Gauss Jordan Elimination calculator that reduces given matrix to row-reduced echelon form.

Input:

  Manual:
    Create a MxN matrix by entering values into corresponding text fields.
    Enter the matrix values into the corresponding cells.
    View the final row echelon form in the window to the right.
      
  File:
    Create a .txt file with each column separated by spaces and each row on its on line.
    Browse for file.
    View the final row echelon form in the window to the right.
      
Output:
  
  Simple: Shows the initial and the final reduced matrices only.
  (WIP) Advanced: Shows the steps performed to get the reduced matrix as well as the initial and reduced matrices.
      

Required:
  Java 7 update 51 or later.
